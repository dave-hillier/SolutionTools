SolutionTools
=============

A Tool to automatically generate Visual Studio Solutions from a set of projects. This tool is designed to use on large legacy projects where dependencies have got too difficult to manage manually. 

Can be used to visualize the references between Visual Studio Projects and referenced assemblies.

*Disclaimer:* 
If you need this to automatically generate solutions (i.e. use this tool), then your project dependencies are likely too complex. Instead, you should attempt to simplify your project structure.
